# Milvus PDF

Great! You have Milvus running in your Kubernetes cluster. Now, to store the text in Milvus, we need to first convert the text into a vector. The main function of Milvus is to handle vector data.

This is generally a two-step process:

1. Converting the text into vectors: Here, you would typically use a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model like BERT or GPT-3 to convert the text into vectors. You can use tools like the Hugging Face Transformers library to do this.


2. Storing the vectors in Milvus: Once you have the vectors, you can use the Milvus Python SDK to insert the vectors into a collection in your Milvus instance.

## Convert text into vectors

Let's first start with converting the text into vectors. You can install the Hugging Face Transformers library with the following command:

```python
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertModel
import torch

tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
model = BertModel.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')

text = "Your text here"
inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model(**inputs)

vector = outputs.last_hidden_state.mean(dim=1).detach().numpy().tolist()[0]
```
