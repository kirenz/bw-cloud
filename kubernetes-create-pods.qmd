## Prepare environment

We make a new directory:

```bash
mkdir github
```

Change into the directory:


```bash
cd github
```

Clone this GitHub-repo into the directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nigelpoulton/TheK8sBook.git
```

List any existing Pods

```bash
sudo kubectl get pods

```

This should output: No resources found in default namespace.


You need to run the following commands from the `pods` folder where you cloned the book’s GitHub repo to:


```bash
cd TheK8sBook/pods

```


## Deploying Pods from a manifest file


Create your Pod with the manifest file *pod.yml*:


```bash
sudo kubectl apply -f pod.yml
```


## Check the status of Pods

Show status of your Pod with:

```bash
sudo kubectl get Pods
```

The Pod is running on a node and is being monitored by the local kubelet process.


To get a more detailed overview use:


```bash
sudo kubectl get pods -o yaml
```

Another option is:


```bash
sudo kubectl describe pods hello-pod
```

## Running commands in Pods 

Execute commands inside the Pod:


```bash
sudo kubectl exec -it hello-pod -- sh

```

- it makes the session interactive

Show Pod hostname inside interactive session:


```bash
env | grep HOSTNAME
```

The hostname of the container is set to the Pod's name.Note that you should alwasy set Pad names as valid DNS names (a-z and 0-9, the minus sign and the period sign).

Type exit to get back to the terminal


```bash
exit
```

## Multi-container Pod - sidecar container

The sidecar container is long-lives and runs alongside the main application container for the entire lifecycle of the Pod.

The first container "ctr-web" is the main app container. It serves as a static web page.

The second container is called "ctr-sync" and is the sidecar. It watches a GitHub repo and syncs changes into the same shared volume.

If the content of the repo change, the "ctr-sync" sidecar will notice and update the web page.

To see it in action, you’ll need a fork of the following GitHub repo. This is so you can make a change to the repo and see those changes reflected by the app. 

https://github.com/nigelpoulton/ps-sidecar

Be sure to update the `GIT_SYNC_REPO` value in the sidecarpod.yml to reflect your forked repo and save your changes:


```bash
sudo nano sidecarpod.yml 

```

Change https://github.com/nigelpoulton/ps-sidecar.git with your GitHub Repo. In my case https://github.com/kirenz/ps-sidecar

Save with Control + O and press enter. Close nano with Control + X.

Run the following command to deploy the application. This will deploy the multi-container Pod as well as a Service object you can use to connect to the app.


```bash
sudo kubectl apply -f sidecar-local.yml

```



Monitor the status with:


```bash
sudo kubectl get pods

```

If the STATUS is running, use this command to get the connection details:


```bash
sudo kubectl get svc

```

```
sudo kubectl describe services svc-sidecar
```

In this example, the external IP address is 10.96.157.189 Also note the value of Port and NodePort. In this example, the Port is 8080 and the NodePort is 30001.


to open a webpage simply type in a terminal window: w3m <url_of_the_webpage>

For example:


```bash
w3m http://172.17.0.1:30001
```

w3m http://172.18.0.2:30001  ??

w3m http://localhost:80:30001


w3m http://10.244.0.8:30001

In the preceding output, you can see that the service has an endpoints: 10.244.0.6:80 This is the internal address of the pod that is running the application. To verify the pod address, enter this command:

```bash
sudo kubectl get pods --output=wide

```


sudo curl http://10.96.157.189:30001

sudo curl http://10.244.0.6:30001

Copy the public IP of the svc-sidecar Service and paste it into your browser to see the webpage


Create a Service object that exposes the deployment:

sudo kubectl expose pod --type=NodePort --name=my-svc-sidecar
