## Create SSH-Key

You can use the SSH-key to access remote servers and to handle authentication for command line programs.


### Windows

Follow the instructions provided in bwCloud: [SSH-Key Paar erzeugen](https://www.bw-cloud.org/de/bwcloud_scope/nutzen)


### MacOS

#### Create key

Open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
ssh-keygen
```
This will output:

```bash
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/username/.ssh/id_rsa):
```

Press enter to save your keys to the default `/Users/username/.ssh` directory.

After entering and confirming your password, you'll see something like the following:

```bash
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/username/.ssh/id_rsa):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /Users/username/.ssh/id_rsa
Your public key has been saved in /Users/username/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:BOJAxs0Rkhusd9Hq/xdqWDnfd1cdxN5Uk+hD2gNwNLA1HvUM username@somename.local
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 3072]----+
| .o*O ..D.BB+...o|
|  .*. .  +o+=E...|
|   ..        ..oo|
|    . ..    oo o=|
|   . . .S     o +|
|           . .  .|
|   ..o. . D.     |
|   .+. .   XC    |
|  .o.o.   L.     |
+----[SHA256]-----+
```

#### Set permissions

Next, we use chmod to change permissions (otherwise, bwCloud will refuse the connection). 


::: {.callout-note}
In Unix and Unix-like operating systems, `chmod` is the command and system call used to change the access permissions of files and directories. The name chmod was chosen as an abbreviation of **ch**ange **mod**e.
:::

Chmod 700 sets folder permissions so that only the owner can read, write and execute files in this folder:

```bash
chmod 700 .ssh
```

Permissions of 600 mean that the owner has full read and write access to the file, while no other user can access the file:

```bash
chmod 600 .ssh/id_rsa
```


#### Mac Finder

1. Open Finder and navigate to `your/Users/username/`

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## How to show your home folder in Finder
If you don't find your home: In Finder, click on the menue and choose: `Finder > Preference > Sidebar > Show these items in the sidebar` and checkmark the box beside the home icon.
:::


1. Now press the `Command + Shift + .` (period) keys at the same time. The hidden files will show up as translucent in your folder.

1. Open the folder `.ssh`.

1. You should see your public SSH key (`id_rsa.pub`) and private SSH key (`id_rsa`) 


## Import public key

1. Open your [bwCloud Dashboard](https://portal.bw-cloud.org)

1. Navigate to *Key Pairs* in the left side menue.

1. Click on *Import Public Key*

1. Provide a *Key Name* and choose *Key Type* SSH Key.

1. Now open your public key `id_rsa.pub` in a code editor like VS Code and copy and paste the content into *Public Key*
