*The following examples are based on Nigel Poulton's "The Kubernetes Book (2022)"*

To prepare the environment we first make a new directory:

```bash
mkdir github
```

Change into the directory:


```bash
cd github
```

Clone this GitHub-repo into the directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nigelpoulton/TheK8sBook.git
```

List any existing Pods

```bash
sudo kubectl get pods

```

This should output: "No resources found in default namespace."
