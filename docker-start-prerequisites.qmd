# Get started with Docker

*This guide is based on the excellent [Docker step-by-step instructions](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) on how to get started with Docker.* 

Some of the things you’ll learn and do in this guide are:

- Build and run an image as a container.
- Share images using Docker Hub.
- Deploy Docker applications using multiple containers with a database.
- Run applications using Docker Compose.

## Prerequisites

To complete this guide, you’ll need the following:

- Docker on your virtual machine in volume `mnt/vdb`. 

- [Visual Studio Code](vs-code-ssh.qmd).

- A conceptual understanding of [containers and images](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/#docker-objects).

## Get the app

Before you can run the application, you need to get the application source code onto your machine.

- Change directory into mnt/vdb

```bash
 cd /mnt/vdb
```


- Clone the getting-started repository using the following command:

```bash
sudo git clone https://github.com/docker/getting-started.git
```

Next, we view the contents of the cloned repository in VS Code.

- Navigate to the VS code menue at the top and choose 'File' > 'Open Folder' and insert: /mnt/vdb/getting-started/app (this will open a new window and you have to insert your SSH-key) 

Inside the getting-started/app directory you should see package.json and two subdirectories (src and spec).
