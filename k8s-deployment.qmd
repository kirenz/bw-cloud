In this tutorial, you’ll see how to use Deployments to bring cloud-native features such as self-healing, scaling, rolling updates, and versioned rollbacks to stateless apps on Kubernetes. 

Deployments are extremely useful and you’ll use them all the time. The chapter is divided as follows: Deployment theory Create a Deployment Perform scaling operations Perform a rollout Perform a rollback

## Prepare environment


Be sure to run the following commands from within the deployments folder. 

cd TheK8sBook/deployments
 

The following YAML snippet is from the `deploy.yml` file. It defines a single-container Pod wrapped in a Deployment object. It’s been annotated to highlight some important sections.


```bash
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: hello-deploy
spec:
  replicas: 10
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: hello-world
  revisionHistoryLimit: 5
  progressDeadlineSeconds: 300
  minReadySeconds: 10
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxUnavailable: 1
      maxSurge: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: hello-world
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: hello-pod
        image: nigelpoulton/k8sbook:1.0
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```


Use kubectl apply to deploy it on the cluster.


```bash
sudo kubectl apply -f deploy.yml 
```

## Inspecting Deployments



```bash
sudo kubectl get deploy hello-deploy
```

```bash
sudo kubectl describe deploy hello-deploy
```

Show ReplicaSet:

```bash
sudo kubectl get rs
```

In my case, the NAME equals hello-deploy-6bbb5f8946


Get more detailed information about the ReplicaSet:


sudo kubectl describe rs hello-deploy-6bbb5f8946

## Accessing the app

Open svc.yml in VS Code and change the port to 30005.

Deploy the Service:

sudo kubectl apply -f svc.yml
