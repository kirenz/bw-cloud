# Change docker location

The standard data directory used for docker is `/var/lib/docker` on our virtual machine. Since this directory will store a lot of data it can become quite large. Therefore, we move the docker data directory to our volumne `mnt/vdb`.

Here are the steps to move the directory:

- Stop docker daemon

```bash
sudo systemctl stop docker

```

- Create a new docker directory in /mnt/vdb:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/vdb/docker

```

- Make a copy of your current docker directory in the new location:

```bash
sudo rsync -a /var/lib/docker/ /mnt/vdb/docker

```

- Create a backup

```bash
sudo mv /var/lib/docker /var/lib/docker-backup
```

- Create a symbolic link (symlink):


```bash
sudo ln -s /mnt/vdb/docker /var/lib/docker
```

- Start docker:

```bash
sudo systemctl start docker
```

- Check if the docker image "hello-world" is still accessible:

```bash
sudo docker ps -a
```

You can now remove your backup:


```bash
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/docker-backup

```

That's it!
