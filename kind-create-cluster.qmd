This guide covers how to configure KIND cluster creation.
https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/configuration/

## What is a Kubernetes cluster?

 Kubernetes cluster is a group of nodes that are used to run containerized applications, and it is managed by a central control plane that ensures that the desired state of the cluster is maintained.


## Cluster creation

To configure kind cluster creation, you will need to create a [YAML](https://yaml.org/) config file. This file follows Kubernetes conventions for versioning etc.

The structure of the Cluster type is defined by a "Go struct", which is described [here](https://pkg.go.dev/sigs.k8s.io/kind/pkg/apis/config/v1alpha4#Cluster)



See config.yaml

To use this config, plac

e the contents in a file config.yaml and then run


```bash
sudo kind create cluster --config=config.yaml 
```

from the same directory.

You can also include a full file path like kind create cluster --config=/foo/bar/config.yaml.
