 Kubernetes cluster is a group of nodes that are used to run containerized applications, and it is managed by a central control plane that ensures that the desired state of the cluster is maintained.

This guide covers how to configure KIND cluster creation.

To configure kind cluster creation, you will need to create a YAML config file. This file follows Kubernetes conventions for versioning etc.
