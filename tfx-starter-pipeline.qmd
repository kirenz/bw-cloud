 ## Prepare environment

Change into directory

Now download the tfx tutorial penguin_simple.ipynb:

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tensorflow/tfx/master/docs/tutorials/tfx/penguin_simple.ipynb


Open the file penguin_simple in VS Code. Use the tfx kernel.


Ignore the first few lines and start the script after "Did you restart the runtime? at "Check the TensorFlow and TFX versions."
