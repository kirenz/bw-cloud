# Introduction {.unnumbered}

The bwCloud is an "infrastructure-as-a-service" environment, specially developed and operated for research and teaching in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg. 

With the bwCloud, virtual servers or virtual machines (VMs) can be created, started and operated. These virtual machines include resources such as virtual CPUs (vCPUs), main memory (RAM), network access (IPv4 and IPv6 addresses) and storage space (storage) and do not differ in operation and administration from "real" physical machines. 

This online book covers how to set up bwCloud.
