## Create environment: ds


We install some modules in a new miniforge environment. We call this new environment `ds` (data science). 

- Copy this code and run it in your terminal: 


```bash
conda create -n ds python=3.10 pandas openpyxl jupyter scikit-learn altair vega_datasets matplotlib seaborn requests tweepy beautifulsoup4 streamlit sqlalchemy psycopg2 xgboost
```

Activate the new environment:

```bash
conda activate ds
```

## Create environment: tf

We install some modules in a new Anaconda environment. We call this new environment `tf` (TensorFlow). 

> On *Windows* open the Start menu and open the "Anaconda Command Prompt". 

> On *macOS*: Open a terminal ([learn how to open a terminal](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/open-or-quit-terminal-apd5265185d-f365-44cb-8b09-71a064a42125/mac)) 


- Copy this code and run it in your terminal: 


```bash
conda create -n tf python=3.9 pandas jupyter tensorflow
```

Activate the new environment:

```bash
conda activate tf
```

## Create environment: tfx

We install some modules in a new environment. We call this new environment `tfx` (TensorFlowExtended). 

- Copy this code and run it in your terminal: 


```bash
conda create -n tfx python=3.9 pip 
```

Activate the new environment:

```bash
conda activate tfx
```

First of all, you have to activate the tf environment:

conda activate tf
Upgrade pip:

pip install --upgrade pip

Now we have to use pip (pip is the package installer for Python) to install TFX. This table describes how the tfx package versions are compatible with its major dependency PyPI packages.

pip install tfx
TensorFlow is already included in tfx.

Install additional modules:

pip install tensorflow-datasets
pip install -U scikit-learn
Congratulations! You have completed the tutorial and learned how to install:

## How to select your environment

In Visual Studio Code:

1. [Create or open a Jupyter Notebook](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks#_create-or-open-a-jupyter-notebook)

1. Next, select a kernel using the kernel picker in the top right (select the Anaconda environment)

![](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/datascience/jupyter/native-kernel-picker.png)


If you can't see your newly created environment:

You can also manually specify an interpreter if Visual Studio Code doesn't locate your kernel automatically.

1. Show command palette: Press `cmd+shift+p` (Mac) or `strl+shift+p` (Windows)

1. Search for `Python: Select InterpreterÂ´

1. Select it and you should see a list of your virtual environments

1. Select the environment of your choice and you are ready to go.
