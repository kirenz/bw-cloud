## Docker

First, we install Docker Engine on Ubuntu. We follow the installation stapes outlined in the [official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)

### Set up Docker repository

Before you install Docker Engine for the first time on a new host machine, you need to set up the Docker repository. Afterward, you can install and update Docker from the repository.

Update the apt package index:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

Install packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS:

```bash
sudo apt-get install \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg \
    lsb-release
```

Confirm the installation with `Y`

Add Docker’s official GPG key:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
```

```bash
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
```

Use the following command to set up the repository:

```bash
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```


### Install Docker Engine

Again, update the apt package index:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

Install Docker Engine, containerd, and Docker Compose:

```bash
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose-plugin
```

Press `Y` to continue

Verify that the Docker Engine installation is successful by running the hello-world image:

```bash
sudo docker run hello-world
```

This command downloads a test image and runs it in a container. When the container runs, it prints a confirmation message and exits.

You have now successfully installed and started Docker Engine. 

The docker user group exists but contains no users, which is why you’re required to use sudo to run Docker commands. 

You may optionally continue to Linux post-install to allow non-privileged users to run Docker commands and for other optional configuration steps.

You can follow these optional [post-installation procedures](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/) which shows you how to configure your Linux host machine to work better with Docker.
