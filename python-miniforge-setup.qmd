## Prepare environment

Change directory into your volume (in may case *vdc*):


```bash
cd /mnt/vdc
```

Create a folder called bin

```bash
sudo mkdir bin
```


## Install miniforge

Change directory into bin


```bash
cd bin
```

Download the latest [Miniforge3 installer](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge):


```bash
sudo curl -L -O "https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh"
```

Start the installation porcess:

```bash
sudo bash Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh
```

Press enter and scroll down

Type `yes` and press enter.

If asked, select your partition as location to save miniforge:


`/mnt/vdc/miniforge`

Accept and type `yes` when asked. This will install miniforge to /mnt/vdc/miniforge



If asked: "Do you wish the installer to initialize Miniforge3
by running conda init? [yes|no]"

Type `yes`


Run `sudo su`, that will open a shell as the superuser.

```bash
sudo su
```

Now add miniforge to path as shown in the command below:

```bash
export PATH=/mnt/vdc/miniforge/bin:$PATH
```

Initialize all shells with:

```bash
conda init --all
```

Type `exit` to exit this shell.


## Install ipykernel


Run `sudo su`, that will open a shell as the superuser.


```bash
sudo su
```

Install the package ipykernel

```bash
conda install ipykernel 
```

Type `exit` to exit this shell.


Now close your connection and restart.


## Start Jupyter Notebook in VS Code

In Visual Studio Code:

1. [Create a Jupyter Notebook](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks#_create-or-open-a-jupyter-notebook)

1. Next, select a kernel using the kernel picker in the top right (select the miniforge environment)

![](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/datascience/jupyter/native-kernel-picker.png)


If you can't see your miniforge environment:

You can also manually specify an interpreter if Visual Studio Code doesn't locate your kernel automatically.

1. Show command palette: Press `cmd+shift+p` (Mac) or `strl+shift+p` (Windows)

1. Search for `Python: Select InterpreterÂ´

1. Select + enter interpreter path 

1. Choose the path (in my case: /mnt/vdc/miniforge/bin/python3.10 )


If the steps described above should not work for you, take a look at other tips at [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43351596/activating-anaconda-environment-in-vscode).
