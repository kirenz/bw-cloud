# Set up Machine Learning Pipelines in bwCloud

WORK IN PROGRESS 

We cover the following topics:


1. Create a **SSH-key** to be able to access the bwCloud server and handle authentication: create-key-pairs


2. Create an instance (i.e. a virtual machine hosted on bwCloud): create-instance


3. Set up Docker: setup-docker 


4. Increase storage and mount to Docker: increase-storage


5. Set up TensorFlow Extended (TFX) with Docker: tfx-setup
