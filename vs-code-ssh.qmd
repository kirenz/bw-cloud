# Visual Studio Code & SSH
 
This tutorial walks you through creating and connecting to a virtual machine (VM) using the Visual Studio Code Remote - SSH extension. 

*To review the complete tutorial, take a look at the [official VS Code documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh-tutorial).*

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need to have done the following steps:

1. If you use Windows, you need to install an [OpenSSH compatible SSH client (PuTTY is not supported)](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/troubleshooting#_installing-a-supported-ssh-client)

2. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

3. Open VS Code and install the ["Remote-SSH"](vscode:extension/ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh) extension


## Connect using SSH

- With the Remote-SSH extension installed, you will see a new status bar item at the far left (at the bottom) in VS Code. 

- The Remote Status bar item can quickly show you in which context VS Code is running (local or remote) and clicking on the item will bring up the Remote - SSH command.

- Choose the "Connect to Host..." command in the Remote-SSH section and connect to the host by entering connection information for your VM in the following format (replace x with your IP): ubuntu@xxx.xxx.xx.xx

- If propmted, enter your passphrase (SSH-key password) in VS Code.

Once you're connected to your SSH host, you can interact with files and open folders on the remote machine:

- Open the Explorer to navigate and open files.

- Open VS Code's integrated terminal, to be able to worke inside a bash shell.

## Port forwarding (optional)

To be able to browse to the web app on your local machine, you can leverage another feature called Port forwarding.

To be able to access a port on the remote machine that may not be publicly exposed, you need to establish a connection or a tunnel between a port on your local machine and the server.

[Port Forwarding](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh#_forwarding-a-port-creating-ssh-tunnel)

With the app still running, open the SSH Explorer and find the Forwarded Ports view. Click on the Forward a port link and indicate that you want to forward  a specific port.
