This tutorial walks you through creating and connecting to a virtual machine (VM) using the Visual Studio Code Remote - SSH extension. To review the complete tutorial, review the [official VS Code documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh-tutorial).


## Prerequisites

To get started, you need to have done the following steps:

1. Install an [OpenSSH compatible SSH client (PuTTY is not supported)](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/troubleshooting#_installing-a-supported-ssh-client)

2. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)


## Install extension

The Remote - SSH extension is used to connect to SSH hosts.

- [Install the extension](vscode:extension/ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh)


## Remote SSH

With the Remote - SSH extension installed, you will see a new green Status bar item at the far left (at the bottom).

The Remote Status bar item can quickly show you in which context VS Code is running (local or remote) and clicking on the item will bring up the Remote - SSH command

## Connect using SSH

You'll have noticed an indicator on the bottom-left corner of the Status bar. This indicator tells you in which context VS Code is running (local or remote). Click on the indicator to bring up a list of Remote extension commands.

Choose the "Connect to Host..." command in the Remote-SSH section and connect to the host by entering connection information for your VM in the following format

Replace x with your IP

ubuntu@xxx.xxx.xx.xx

Once you're connected to your SSH host, you can interact with files and open folders on the remote machine. 

If you open the integrated terminal (âŒƒ`), you'll see you're working inside a bash shell while you're on Windows

Open the Explorer to navigate and open files.


## Port forwarding

To be able to browse to the web app on your local machine, you can leverage another feature called Port forwarding.

To be able to access a port on the remote machine that may not be publicly exposed, you need to establish a connection or a tunnel between a port on your local machine and the server.

[Port Forwarding](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh#_forwarding-a-port-creating-ssh-tunnel)

With the app still running, open the SSH Explorer and find the Forwarded Ports view. Click on the Forward a port link and indicate that you want to forward port 30001:

Name the connection "browser":
