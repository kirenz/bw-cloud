## Prepare environment

We make a new directory:

```bash
mkdir github
```

Change into the directory:


```bash
cd github
```

Clone this GitHub-repo into the directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nigelpoulton/TheK8sBook.git
```

List any existing Pods

```bash
sudo kubectl get pods

```

This should output: No resources found in default namespace.


You need to run the following commands from the `pods` folder where you cloned the bookâ€™s GitHub repo to:


```bash
cd TheK8sBook/pods

```


## Create Pods from a manifest file


Create your Pod with the manifest file *pod.yml*:


```bash
sudo kubectl apply -f pod.yml
```


## Check the status of Pods

Show status of your Pod with:

```bash
sudo kubectl get Pods
```

The Pod is running on a node and is being monitored by the local kubelet process.


To get a more detailed overview use:


```bash
sudo kubectl get pods -o yaml
```

Another option is:


```bash
sudo kubectl describe pods hello-pod
```

## Running commands in Pods 

Execute commands inside the Pod:


```bash
sudo kubectl exec -it hello-pod -- sh

```

- it makes the session interactive
