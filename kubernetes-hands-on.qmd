We make a new directory


```bash
mkdir github

```

Change into the directory


```bash
cd github
```

Clone this GitHub-repo


```bash
git clone https://github.com/nigelpoulton/TheK8sBook.git

```

## Hands on with Pods


List any existing Pods

```bash
sudo kubectl get pods

```

This should output: No resources found in default namespace.


## Pod manifest files

Poulton, Nigel. The Kubernetes Book: 2022 Edition (S.58). leanpub.com. Kindle-Version. 


You need to run the following commands from the pods folder where you cloned the bookâ€™s GitHub repo to.


```bash
cd github/TheK8sBook/pods

```

Create your Pod with the manifest file pod.yml


```bash
sudo kubectl apply -f pod.yml
```


Check for the status


```bash
sudo kubectl get Pods
```

The Pod is running on a node and is being monitored by the local kubelet process.


To get a more detailed overview use:


```bash
sudo kubectl get pods -o yaml
```
